I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington.

My research focuses on the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **AI Safety**. I am particularly interested in:

- **LLM Security & Safety** - Understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities in large language models
- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Designing robust architectures for collaborative AI agents
- **Coding Agent Safety** - Ensuring secure and reliable autonomous code generation
- **AI Ethics** - Exploring the societal implications of advanced AI systems

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a **Software Development Engineer at Amazon**, where I built backend systems for ad delivery. I also hold a Master's degree from Georgia State University, where I worked on spatio-temporal data analysis.

I am passionate about building AI systems that are not only powerful but also safe, secure, and aligned with human values.
