## Overview

Developed a machine learning model to classify breast cancer patients into malignant and benign categories, achieving high accuracy in early detection.

## Technical Details

- **Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Keras
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy:** 96.50%
- **Recall:** 95.47%

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and normalized features
2. **Feature Engineering:** Selected most relevant diagnostic features
3. **Model Selection:** Compared multiple classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
4. **Evaluation:** Used cross-validation and confusion matrix analysis

## Results

The Random Forest classifier achieved the best performance with:
- High accuracy (96.50%) for reliable predictions
- Strong recall (95.47%) to minimize false negatives, crucial for cancer detection

## Impact

This project demonstrates the potential of ML in healthcare for early cancer detection, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely diagnosis.
