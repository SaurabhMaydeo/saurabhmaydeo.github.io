# About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Texas at Arlington, majoring in Computer Science and working with Dr. Jacob Luber at Luber Lab. My research focuses on applying Machine Learning and Health Data Science to omic data for advancements in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and drug discovery.

## Past Experience

Prior to my PhD journey, I worked at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. I graduated with a Master's of Science in Computer Science from Georgia State University in Dec 2022, during which I got an opportunity to work as a Graduate Research Assistant at DMLab and Graduate Teaching Assistant for CSC 8850 Advanced Machine Learning under Dr. Sergey Plis.

Outside of my research and family commitments, I love to unwind by listening to music, cooking, and exploring new places.
