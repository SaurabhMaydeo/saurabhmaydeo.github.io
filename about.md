I am applying Machine Learning and Health Data Science to omic data for advancements in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and drug discovery. My research aims to bridge the gap between data science and clinical applications, contributing to the development of new drugs and treatment strategies that improve patient outcomes.

Outside of my research and family commitments, I love to unwind by listening to music, cooking, and exploring new places.
